## Importance of associations.

Lots of important tasks could not be solved by a single individual.  Typical example is military security.  Thus associations of individuals are important.  To create an association, several individuals state:
- the goal of the association,
- rules of admission and membership, that state exhaustive list of rights, delegated to the association and cases when they are delegated,
- the process of collection of resources (e.g. funds) for the stated goals,
- the process of making joint decisions to use collected resources
- the order of profits and losses distribution,
- the procedure for resolving internal disputes,
- the procedure of leaving the association (responsibility for breaking the agreement)

The association is dissolved as soon as the goal is achieved.

Examples include: association of landowners (village community), the professional for-profit association (corporation), mutual insurance associations (medical or age), military territorial association.

As the result of fundamental rights, individuals that aren't members of association can not count on the help of the association (for example military or police assistance) and thus are responsible for their NON-participation.  Symmetrically, members of society bear the consequences of failure to provide assistance to people who suffer.
